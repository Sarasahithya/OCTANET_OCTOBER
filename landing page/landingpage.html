            <h1>(1)Continental</h1>
            <h3>Continental islands: </h3>
            <h5>These islands were once connected to a continent, such as New Zealand and New Caledonia. Some continental islands were once mountains and hills along the coast during the last Ice Age. </h5>

                <h1>(2)Tidal </h1>
                <h3>Tidal islands: </h3>
                <h5>A tidal island is a raised area of land within a waterbody, which is connected to the larger mainland by a natural isthmus or man-made causeway that is exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide, causing the land to switch between being a promontory/peninsula and an island depending on tidal conditions.
    
                    Because of the mystique surrounding tidal islands, many of them have been sites of religious worship, such as Mont-Saint-Michel with its Benedictine abbey. Tidal islands are also commonly the sites of fortresses because of the natural barrier created by the tidal channel.</h5>

            <p> <h1>(3)Barrier</h1>
                <h3>Barrier islands: </h3>
                <h5>Barrier islands are a coastal landform, a type of dune system and sand island, where an area of sand has been formed by wave and tidal action parallel to the mainland coast.[1] They usually occur in chains, consisting of anything from a few islands to more than a dozen. They are subject to change during storms and other action, but absorb energy and protect the coastlines and create areas of protected waters where wetlands may flourish. A barrier chain may extend for hundreds of kilometers, with islands periodically separated by tidal inlets. The largest barrier island in the world is Padre Island of Texas, United States, at 113 miles (182 km) long.[2] Sometimes an important inlet may close permanently, transforming an island into a peninsula, thus creating a barrier peninsula,[3] often including a beach, barrier beach.  </h5>

            <p><h1>(4)Oceanic</h1>
                <h3>Oceanic islands: </h3>
                <h5>Oceanic islands are islands that rise from the ocean floor, and are different from continental islands, which are parts of the continental shelf that are surrounded by water.  </h5>
                <img src="oceanic.jpg"></p>
            <p><h1>(5)Coral</h1>
                <h3>Coral islands: </h3>
                <h5>Coral islands are islands formed from coral detritus and organic material, and are typically found in tropical and subtropical areas. They are often part of a coral reef that has grown to cover a large area underwater. </h5>

            <p><h1>(6)Artificial</h1>
                <h3>Artificial islands: </h3>
                <h5>Artificial islands are made by draining water from seafloors or from pilling dredged sediment and sand onto seafloors and submerged coral reefs, which can have substantial impacts to marine species (e.g., de Groot, 1979). From: Encyclopedia of the World's Biomes, 2020. </h5>
